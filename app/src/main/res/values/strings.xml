    <string name="dummy_description">An inspirational sight, these giant dish antennas of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) rise above the New Mexico desert at moonset.  Mounted on piers but transportable on railroad tracks to change theVLAâ€™s configuration, its 27 operating antennas are
each house-sized (25 meters across) and can be
organized into an array spanning the size of a city
(35 kilometers). A prolific radio astronomy workhorse, the VLA has been used to discover water on planet Mercury, radio-bright coronae around stars,
micro-quasars in our Galaxy, gravitationally-induced
Einstein rings around distant galaxies, and radio
counterparts to cosmologically distant gamma-ray
bursts. Its vast size has allowed astronomers to study </string>
